        <h1 class="quake">Places I Have Lived</h1>

                <h3 class="quake">Stockholm, Sweden</h3>
                    <p class="quake"> This is where I was born and raised through elementary school. Sweden is a sparsely populated country,
                        characterised by its long coastline, extensive forests and numerous lakes.
                        It is one of the world's northernmost countries. In terms of surface area it is comparable to Spain,
                        Thailand or the American state of California.
                        Sweden's borders have been unchanged since 1905 and the country has not been at war since 1814. </p>

                <h3 class="quake">Accra, Ghana</h3>
                    <p class="quake"> This where I lived with my parents when we moved to Ghana. Accra is the capital of Ghana with about 2 million residents.
                        Ghana is a small country about the size of Minnesota. It is located in West Africa on the Atlantic Coast. It experiences lots of sunshine
                        but not as humid as Missouri. Ghana is the place to be to experience real hospitality and friendly people. While there you must certainly
                        try out spicy delights like 'kelewele' and 'Waakye'!</p>

                <h3 class="quake">Kumasi, Ghana</h3>
                    <p class="quake"> Kumasi is where I went to high school and college. Opoku Ware School was my High School and Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology
                        is where I went to university. I did general science at highschool and proceeded to do Civil Engineering at the University. Kumasi is the 2nd
                        largest city in Ghana with great cultural heritage. It is the home of the Ashanti Kingdom where most of the gold from Ghana comes from. Ghana
                        was actually know as the 'Gold Coast' in the 19th Centuary.</p>

                <h3 class="quake">St Louis, United States</h3>
                    <p class="quake"> St Louis is where I currently live. I have been here for a year now and it has been great!. It is an awesome combination of a city with all <thead>
                        desired small town flavors. Little traffic, lower pace of life, friendly people; all in an urban space of littered wih diverse restaurants, lovely parks
                        and spectacular public events! I do miss home but St Louis does well to help me not get too home sick. </p>
